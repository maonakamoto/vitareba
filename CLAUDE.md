# VitaReBa — Project Standards

**What this is:** Clinical patient management platform for VitaReBa GmbH — a metabolic psychiatry & systemic longevity clinic in Zürich, founded by Manuel (also founder of Surf Your Life). Flagship programme is ADHD diagnosis and optimisation for high performers.

The platform has two parts:
1. **Public marketing site** — multilingual (de/en/fr/it), lands at `/de/`, primary CTA is the Inflection Edge self-assessment overlay
2. **Patient portal + admin panel** — authenticated, database-backed, at `/dashboard` (patients) and `/admin` (Manuel)

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, `standalone` output) · TypeScript strict · Tailwind v4 · self-hosted PostgreSQL (`pg` driver) · Drizzle ORM · NextAuth 5 · Resend email · self-hosted on the Hetzner box ("bitbaum") behind Caddy, served at `vitareba.ch`. Scheduled jobs run via systemd timers / cron on the box; documents are stored on local disk and served by Caddy under `/uploads/*`.

## Mission

**Who:** Manuel Schabus, metabolic psychiatry clinician at VitaReBa Zürich, and his high-performer ADHD patients.
**Problem:** Patients need frictionless daily data collection so their biology is visible; Manuel needs instant clarity on which patients need attention — and the marketing site must let curious visitors experience the Inflection Edge *before* hitting an auth wall.
**Success:** Manuel opens the admin and knows — without calling anyone — exactly who needs attention today. Patients check in daily because the portal shows them it matters. Visitors complete the Inflection Edge without being asked to register first, then convert because the results made them want to.

## Database Schema (Drizzle + self-hosted PostgreSQL)

Tables: `users`, `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` (NextAuth), `profiles`, `dailyCheckins` (unique on user_id+date), `assessmentResults`, `bookings`, `documents`, `threads`, `threadMessages` (with `readAt` for unread tracking), `patientNotes`, `programmeAssignments`, `clinicalGoals`, `emailQueue`

**Migrations (versioned, auto-applied):** after editing `lib/db/schema.ts`, run
`pnpm db:generate` and COMMIT the new `drizzle/*.sql` — the deploy schema step
(fleetcrown `scripts/hetzner/apply-schema.sh`) applies pending migrations to
prod automatically on every deploy (additive-only, transactional; destructive
diffs abort the deploy for a human). `pnpm db:push` is for local dev DBs only —
never push schema to prod by hand.

---

## SSOT — Where Each Thing Lives

| What | Where | Never in |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design tokens (colors, spacing) | `app/globals.css` `:root` | Hardcoded hex anywhere |
| Shared utility CSS | `app/globals.css` | Duplicated across modules |
| Component-specific CSS | Co-located `.module.css` | `globals.css` or inline `style={{}}` |
| Company info (name, email, PORTAL_URL) | `lib/config/company.ts` | Hardcoded in components |
| Programme/phase labels | `lib/config/programmes.ts` | Any component |
| Signal thresholds + labels | `lib/config/admin.ts` | Any component |
| Assessment questions, scoring | `lib/assessment/data.ts` | Any component |
| DB schema | `lib/db/schema.ts` | Separate type files |
| Portal route paths | `lib/config/routes.ts` PORTAL_ROUTES | Hardcoded strings |
| Auth pages routing | `proxy.ts` (derives from PORTAL_ROUTES) | Scattered guards |

**The 2-file test:** Adding a team member = 1 file. Changing company email = 1 file. Adding a programme phase = 1 file. More than that → architecture is wrong.

---

## Middleware Routing Model

`proxy.ts` at the project root handles two distinct routing concerns (Next.js middleware):

```
/dashboard, /assessment, /assessments, /bookings, /checkin,
/messages, /profile, /admin, /api
  → PORTAL mode: auth-guard only, no locale routing
  → Unauthenticated → redirect to /login?returnTo=...
  → Non-admin hitting /admin → redirect to /dashboard

Everything else (/, /de/*, /en/*, etc.)
  → MARKETING mode: next-intl locale routing
  → Logged-in users on /de/login, /de/register, etc. → redirect to /dashboard or /admin/patients
```

**Adding a new portal route:** Add it to `PORTAL_ROUTES` in `lib/config/routes.ts` — the middleware derives `PORTAL_PREFIXES` from this automatically. No need to touch `proxy.ts`.

---

## Patient Signal System

`lib/domain/signals.ts` → `computePatientSignal()` — pure function, testable.

| Signal | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|
| `new` | Registered < `NEW_PATIENT_GRACE_DAYS` days ago |
| `critical` | No check-in ≥ 5 days, OR 3 consecutive declining wellness days, OR assessment dropped > 10 pts |
| `attention` | No assessment yet, OR has assessment but no booking |
| `active` | Everything normal |

Used in: `/admin/patients` list, `/api/cron/signals` (alerts admin on first `critical` transition), `/admin/reports`.

---

## Cron Jobs

All routes under `/api/cron/*` require `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET`. On the self-hosted box these are triggered by systemd timers / cron entries that curl each route with the bearer token. The canonical schedule list still lives in `vercel.json` (kept as the single source of truth for the schedules — the box's timers mirror it):

| Route | Schedule | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `cron/emails` | Daily 08:00 | Process email queue (welcome, assessment, engagement sequences) |
| `cron/signals` | Daily 02:00 | Compute signals, email admin on new criticals |
| `cron/checkin-reminder` | Daily 07:00 | Remind patients to check in (skips opted-out + already-done) |
| `cron/checkin-dip-alert` | Daily 09:00 | Alert admin on consecutive wellness dips |
| `cron/weekly-digest` | Sunday 08:00 | Weekly summary email to patients |

---

## Clinical Goals

Goals are set by admin per patient (`/api/admin/patients/[id]/goals`). Each goal has:
- `title` — e.g. "Improve sustained focus"
- `metric` — optional key linking to data source: `"focus"`, `"mood"`, `"overallScore"`, etc.
- `baseline`, `target`, `current` — 0–100 integers
- Progress: `((current - baseline) / (target - baseline)) * 100` — NOT `current/target`

`cron/signals` auto-updates `current` from latest check-in averages or assessment scores when `metric` is set.

---

## Email System

- **Provider:** Resend (`lib/email/index.ts`)
- **From address:** `RESEND_FROM` env var. Use `onboarding@resend.dev` until `vitareba.ch` is DNS-verified in Resend dashboard.
- **Templates:** `lib/email/templates.ts` — all emails defined here, imported by cron routes and API routes
- **Queue:** `emailQueue` table — sequences scheduled on assessment/registration, processed by `cron/emails`
- **Immediate sends:** password reset, new message notification (fire-and-forget in API routes)

---

## Document Storage

Documents are stored on the box's local disk via `lib/storage.ts` (`putLocal`/`delLocal`), under `UPLOADS_DIR`, and served by Caddy under `/uploads/*`. The `documents.fileUrl` column stores the root-relative URL (`/uploads/<key>`). Upload via `/api/documents` (POST with FormData). `DocumentAddForm` handles the upload client-side.

---

## Assessment — How It Works

The Inflection Edge runs both as a public overlay (marketing site → conversion) and as a logged-in portal page (`/assessment`). Completing the assessment while logged in saves results to the DB.

```
lib/assessment/data.ts
  DIMENSIONS (5)         → Arousal, Divergent, Hyperfocus, Volatility, Environment
  QUESTIONS (30)         → 6 per dimension
  VERDICT_TIERS          → 4 tiers: Deep Friction / Managed Tension / Asymmetric Performance / Optimised
  INTERPRETATIONS        → per-dimension text, 3 tiers each
  scoreColor(score)      → CSS var string for score colouring
```

**Scoring:** Each Q answered 1–5. Per dimension: `(sum / maxPossible) * 100`. Overall: mean of dimension scores.

**To add a question / change interpretations:** Edit only `lib/assessment/data.ts`.

## Connection to Surf Your Life

VitaReBa and Surf Your Life are separate brands — same founder, different platforms.

| | VitaReBa | Surf Your Life |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | Clinical / medical | Coaching / transformation |
| Audience | ADHD high performers, longevity patients | Burnout recovery, general wellbeing |
| Contact | `manuel@surfyourlife.org` (SSOT: `lib/config/company.ts`) | Same founder |

**Do not** merge codebases. **Do not** share components. They share philosophy, not code.

---

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # local dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build        # production build — run before every push
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm db:push      # push schema changes to the self-hosted Postgres
pnpm db:generate  # generate migration files
pnpm db:studio    # Drizzle Studio for DB inspection
pnpm verify       # lint + typecheck + test — the pre-done gate (mirrors CI)
```

**Before declaring any change done, run `pnpm verify`.** It runs the same
hermetic gates as CI (lint + typecheck + the full test suite), so green locally
means green on the shared branch — don't hand work back for manual smoke-testing
that `verify` already covers. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) re-runs the same
gates plus `build` on every push and PR to `main`.

## Deploy Workflow (self-hosted Hetzner box)

Deployment is a pull-and-restart on the box, not a managed platform push. After `git push`, the box pulls the new commit, runs `pnpm build` (Next.js `standalone` output), and the systemd service is restarted. Verify the site is live before reporting done:

```bash
# Confirm the app responds after a deploy/restart
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://vitareba.ch/de
```

If it fails: check the service logs on the box (`journalctl -u <vitareba-service> -n 100`), fix, `pnpm build`, push again. Full migration/runbook: `fleetcrown/docs/infrastructure/hetzner-migration.md`.

## Red Flags

- Color hex directly in component → use `var(--teal)` etc.
- Inline `style={{}}` in a component → move to co-located `.module.css`
- New portal route not added to `PORTAL_ROUTES` in `lib/config/routes.ts` → unauthenticated users get a 404
- Signal threshold hardcoded in a cron route → belongs in `lib/config/admin.ts`
- Email template inline in an API route → belongs in `lib/email/templates.ts`
- `style={{}}` props on portal/admin pages → use portal.module.css / admin.module.css
- Goal progress as `(current/target)*100` → correct formula is `((current-baseline)/(target-baseline))*100`
- `computePatientSignal` logic modified without updating tests in `lib/domain/signals.test.ts`
