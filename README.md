# VitaReBa

Clinical patient management platform for **VitaReBa GmbH** — a metabolic psychiatry and systemic longevity clinic in Zürich. The platform has two parts:

1. **Public marketing site** — multilingual (de/en/fr/it), with the *Inflection Edge* self-assessment overlay as the primary CTA.
2. **Patient portal + admin panel** — authenticated and database-backed: patients at `/dashboard`, the clinician at `/admin`.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, `standalone` output) · TypeScript (strict)
- **Tailwind v4** (tokens in `app/globals.css`, no `tailwind.config.*`)
- **PostgreSQL** (self-hosted) via **Drizzle ORM** (`pg` driver)
- **NextAuth 5** (auth) · **Resend** (transactional email)
- **next-intl** (i18n)

## Hosting

Self-hosted on the Hetzner box ("bitbaum") behind Caddy, served at **https://vitareba.ch**. There is no managed platform — deployment is pull, `pnpm build` (standalone output), and a systemd service restart. Uploaded documents are stored on local disk and served by Caddy under `/uploads/*`. Scheduled `/api/cron/*` jobs run from systemd timers / cron on the box (schedules defined in `CLAUDE.md` → Cron Jobs).

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp env.local.example .env.local   # fill in DATABASE_URL, auth + Resend secrets
pnpm db:push                      # apply the Drizzle schema to your Postgres
pnpm dev                          # http://localhost:3000
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # dev server
pnpm build        # production build (standalone)
pnpm start        # serve the production build
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test         # vitest run
pnpm db:push      # push schema changes to Postgres
pnpm db:generate  # generate migration files
pnpm db:studio    # Drizzle Studio
```
